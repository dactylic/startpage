# Startpage
Customized homepage written in HTML/CSS/Javascript. Features temperature, condition, wind speed, and a formatted list of relevant links.

# Weather 
Startpage uses AJAX and JQuery to retrieve weather data from OpenWeather (https://home.openweathermap.org/) and displays the temperature, condition, and windspeed at the location of the user. 

I don't know much about JavaScript so I followed the guide here: https://medium.com/weekly-webtips/build-a-weather-widget-using-javascript-65717a929c24. I used the OpenWeather API to add the wind measurement to my version.

# Links
I have set the default links to be the sites I most commonly visit / open when I load Firefox. If you want to change them, in startpage.html change the links wrapped in "<a href= </a>" to whatever you want. 

# Example

Default Startpage looks like this:
